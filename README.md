> _"Better to Light a Candle Than to Curse the Darkness"_

This repository contains learning resources of all kinds and my personal comments. The purpose is for me to track my own progress on subjects that I want to learn or to improve.

### Learn to Learn
- [X] [The Power of Tiny Gains](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement)
    
    Improve 1% per day and you will be 37 times better in a year.
    * Do more of what already works. Stop trying to add unnecessary new methods and tools, you already know a lot. 
    * Avoid tiny losses. Removing what blocks you can have a better impact than focusing on new things to add to your life.
    * Measure your tiny accomplishments on a regular basis, evaluating your progress to know whether you are improving yourself or not.
