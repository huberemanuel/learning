# Learning

> _"Better to Light a Candle Than to Curse the Darkness"_

This repository contains learning resources of all kinds and my personal comments. The purpose is for me to track my own progress on subjects that I want to learn or to improve.

> This repo is totally inspired by [Amit Chaudhary](https://github.com/amitness/learning)

### Learn to Learn
- [X] [The Power of Tiny Gains](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement)
    
    Improve 1% per day and you will be 37 times better in a year.
    * Do more of what already works. Stop trying to add unnecessary new methods and tools, you already know a lot. 
    * Avoid tiny losses. Removing what blocks you can have a better impact than focusing on new things to add to your life.
    * Measure your tiny accomplishments on a regular basis, evaluating your progress to know whether you are improving yourself or not.

    Skills are not easily attainable. In that sense, speeches that highlight that you can be a rockstar researcher or even the next Bill Gates are false. Malcolm Gladwell says in his book ( Outliers: The Story of Success) that it takes 10,000 hours for someone to master a subject, Akita mentions that an intern would need at least 1,400 hours to get his first internship. Learning is not easy, you need to progress every day and enjoy the process.

    Akita emphasizes that high salaries with low-value delivery bring a bubble situation. At some moment it will explode and vanish the majority of those unrealistic opportunities. 
    In practice, you can only receive the amount of value that you deliver.

    You should not stick to study programs. In his vision, the best way to learn is by working on practical problems and overcome difficulties as they arise.
    To face the difficulties, it is necessary to know how to ask the right questions. The correct answer is worthless if it is not accompanied by the correct question, as in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

    One of the difficulties of using Kubeflow is to have to setup a cluster and to work with Kubernetes. Kubeflow is focused on production environments, so I would not recommend it to a researcher that only want to have the pipelines and reproducibility gains from that architecture.

### Software Engineering
- [X] [A Visual Guide to Regular Expression](https://amitness.com/regex/)

    Simple and concise tutorial on regex.
### Misc
- [X] [Neuro Symbolic AI - David Cox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbDcMPbumlU&t=651s)

    Deep Learning can't deal with slightly changed objects on a view, on the other hand, humans can understand those variations easily. This brings security and quality concerns.

    Neurosymbolic uses NNs for learning from unstructured data and symbolic systems to give the final system answers. The system presented is trained with Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

    >"Actual DL systems works on correlations, if a new variable is presented to the system then the system is broke" - David.
